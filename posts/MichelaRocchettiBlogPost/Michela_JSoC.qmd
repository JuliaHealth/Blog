# About me 
Hi, I am Michela, I am from Rome and I hold a Master's degree in Physics of complex systems. My interest topics are the usage of modeling and AI methodologies in healthcare.

# Project description 

The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a native Julia package to interact with the APIs built around IPUMS datasets, 
provide useful utilities in this package to manipulate IPUMS data sources,
 and compose this package with the broader Julia ecosystem to enable novel research in health, economics, and more. In a long term view, 
 IPUMS.jl can be used as a viable alternative to IPUMS.

 The informations and the data collected by IPUMS are useful for comparative research, as well as analysis of indiviudals in their living context and 
 those data can be used for crating a more comprehensive dataset to be at disposal, facilitating research into social determinant of health data for different types of 
 diseases, social communities and geographical areas.


# Tasks and Goals

1. Expand some of the functionality drafted in ipumsr  IPUMS NHGIS
    - Create a link between OpenAPI documentation and the functions internally used in IPUMS.jl:
    updating already present function, determine if updating is needed and test them
    - Develop functionality similar to the get_metadata_nghis function present in ipumsr

2. Update IPUMS documentation
    - Set-up and deploy of DocumenterVitepress.jl  
    - Write a blog post on how IPUMS.jl can compose within the ecosystem.
